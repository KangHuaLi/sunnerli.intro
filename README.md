I'm not just study for study, but getting enthusiastic for dreaming!!! Even though not being a genius, I will keep using my passion and ability to solve the some problem, and help my friends to solve their problem. Maybe I can change the world for a little little bits....

Education

1. The fundamental concept about the **calculus** and **probability**, including some basic idea about the distribution and its measure which help me to understand the probability view of machine learning. 

2. The fundamental concept about the **machine learning**, including parametric model(LR, Bayesian LR, predictive LR, logistic regression), memory based model(KNN, SVM and GP), combinational model(Decision tree, random forest) and clustering.    

3. The fundamental concept about the **Deep learning**, including discriminative model(DNN, CNN, RNN, Seq2Seq) and generative model(GAN, DCGAN, WGAN)
